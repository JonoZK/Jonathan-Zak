          {type:'p', text:`In conjunction with the dynamic drop tower facility, I am currently developing a custom shock tube test facility to study the dynamic strain response of carbon fiber cylinders under high-rate loading. For a detailed background on my ongoing carbon fiber research please refer to the dynamic drop tower project as it is first in chronological order. My goal with the shock tube test facility is to deliver high-rate pressure loading to carbon fiber cylinders by developing an attachment to an existing steel shock tube, where my carbon fiber cylinders can be attached. 
 A central focus of my work has been the instrumentation setup, where I integrated both Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors and resistive strain gauges (RSGs) to capture hoop and axial strain during shock events. To support these high-speed measurements, I designed a data acquisition workflow using a National Instruments DAQ and LabVIEW interface, ensuring synchronization and clean signal capture at high sampling rates. This instrumentation framework lays the foundation for extracting meaningful strain data in complex, transient loading environments.

          {type:'p', text:`To physically interface the shock tube with carbon fiber test sections, I designed and machined custom aluminum flanges using CNC milling and manual finishing techniques. These flanges provide precise sealing and load transfer between the pressure-driven shock tube and the composite cylinders, while also allowing for repeatable installation of test specimens. This machining effort not only ensured robust mechanical connections but also allowed flexibility in adapting the facility for different specimen geometries.
Safety was also a key design driver throughout this project. I constructed a steel mesh safety cage around the shock tube to contain debris in the unlikely event of cylinder rupture, drawing on best practices from aerospace labs and defense research facilities. With the initial setup complete, I have already performed early benchmarking tests on my composite cylinders to validate system performance, calibrating sensors and verifying pressure wave consistency through the tube. These results confirmed both the functionality of the facility and the reliability of the instrumentation, giving me confidence as I progress toward more advanced testing campaigns on carbon fiber aerospace structures. This is my most ongoing work and will lead to my masters thesis, in the future I will investigate the strain response over repeated dynamic shock loading, the effects of different fiber layup configurations, and developing a multi-physics FEM simulation to compare with experimental data.

        content:[
          {type:'p', text:`During my senior year, I was selected to join Vanderbilt University’s Rocket Competition team, where we competed against over 50 other universities in the NASA Student Launch Challenge. The 2024 challenge required teams to design a lander that could be deployed at 400 feet above ground level during rocket descent, land under human survivable conditions, and decelerate without a parachute. Our solution was a remotely deployed coaxial drone inspired by NASA’s Ingenuity drone.
As the payload integration engineer, I was responsible for the Payload Deployment System (PDS), which needed to support and protect our 11 lb. drone throughout rocket flight and then deploy it in a stable manner at precisely 400 ft. I also served as the team’s Safety Officer and performed structural analysis of the vehicle’s load path. Designing the PDS required balancing several unique challenges: integrating the drone’s unconventional form factor into the rocket, ensuring deployment did not impart excessive momentum during startup, and developing an autonomous release system that functioned only after receiving Range Safety Officer (RSO) approval. This work required close collaboration with both the payload and vehicle teams to ensure proper integration.

          {type:'p', text:`The final PDS design incorporated two electro-mechanical rotary latches that secured the drone via striker pins offset from the rocket centerline to avoid interference with the coaxial propulsion system. These latches were fastened to a custom CNC-machined aluminum bulk plate, which transferred loads through four threaded rods running between fore and aft bulk plates. Two 3D-printed Onyx centering plates improved assembly and reduced the risk of buckling. To accommodate the drone, the payload team and I developed foldable propellers, which were protected in-flight by a central “protection tube” secured to the aft bulk plate. For separation detection, neodymium magnets were bonded to the fore bulk plate, triggering hall effect sensors that initiated the drone’s startup sequence once released.
The deployment electronics were developed with the electrical engineering team. We built the system around a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller and a TBS Crossfire RF link, chosen for its reliability and secure frequency-hopping protocol. The software activated upon rocket launch, detected apogee through an altimeter, and continuously monitored altitude. Once the vehicle descended below 400 ft and received an RSO approval signal, the microcontroller sent a release command to the latches, initiating the drone’s mission.

          {type:'p', text:"Starting in May 2024 myself and my lab colleagues, Jose Leonardo Brenes and Rais Nurhidajat, began work on a novel drone configuration. The motivation behind the project was to explore methods of increasing power effeciency of drones thus increasing their flight time and haulage capabilities. A typical quadcopter uses 4 radial motors to control the roll, pitch, and yaw as well as the thrust of the drone. As a consequence, controlling the attitude of the drone also effects the output thrust.Our team theorized that by adding a central coaxial motor to a quadcopter, the thrust and the attitude control could be effectively decoupled and therefore the power effeciency of the drone could be improved "},

A powerful coaxial drone was chosen to provide the thrust and yaw control of the drone. The coaxial motor in reality consists of two contra-rotating motors to cancel out their respective torques, however by running the motors at differential rpm's and therefore torques, this way the yaw can be controlled. The 4 smaller quadcopter motors were sized to use less power and take advantage of long moment arms to control the roll and pitch of the drone. My primary contributions to the project included sizing the smaller quadcopter motors, 3D printing custom structural components of the drone, altering COTS drone parts to fit our needs, altering open-source Ardupilot code to integrate with our novel configuration, and perform data analysis after flight testing."},

The team was aiming for a power consumption ratio of 90% between the large coaxial motor and smaller quadcopter motors. Initial tests placed the ratio at approximatly 82%. Moving into the fall of 2024 as Leonardo left, I took over leadership of the project, while working alonside another colleague Andrew Noonan. Together we worked on increasing this power consumption ratio to 90%. The primary alterations were decreasing the size of the quadcopter motors while extending their moment arm to preserve controlling torque and further iterating our Ardupilot code to more effeciently control our all of our motors from the RC controller. After these modifictions the drone acheived a power ratio of 88%, close to our inital goal. Currently we are is discussions with the university Technology Tranfer Office to explore a patent on our design. Sample drone flight videos are shown below."},

The team built and tested multiple prototypes of the autorotation. Utilizing different propellor sizes and configurations, propellor pitches, and structural design choices. The autorotators were instrumented with an rpm sensor, altimeter, and imu to give the team valuable flight data to evaluate and iterate on our designs.  Rais worked primarily on test simulations using Blade Momentum theory, and Leo handled the instrumentation and fabrication of the landers. My responsibilities included the structural design of the lander and CFD simulations to predict the stability of the autorotator in the air before high stake drop tests. Our team tested by bringing our autorotator up 400 ft via a heavy lift drone before releasing them using the RF payload detachment mechanism highlighted in my “USLI” project section.
